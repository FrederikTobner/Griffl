# Drawing tools

Use struct inheritance to implement the drawing tools.

Every tool should have a color.

* Fill
* Brush
* Line
* Circle
* Square (only circular shape for now)

These tools addionaly have a size.

* Brush
* Line
* Circle
* Square (only circular shape for now)

These tools need only a size.

* Eraser

We could also implement it uusing a drawing configuration type.
Then we would have size and a primary and secondary color.
We could additionally mirror the drawing on the x and y axis.

## Other tools that could be implemented

* Move
* Select
* Text
* Spray
